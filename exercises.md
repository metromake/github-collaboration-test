## Exercise 3: Git Workflow for the project

This is a group assignment. Design a branching strategy for your software development project.

Write a one page report describing the best git workflow for your team. Explain the reasons why you chose such a strategy. This document is a mutual agreement for your team how your code development flow should go. Descibe also what are the general guidelines for your commit messages.

Remember that the best branching strategy for your project depends on factors like team size, project size, release cadence, and development style. It's also important to document and communicate your chosen strategy to ensure that everyone on the team understands how to use it effectively.
